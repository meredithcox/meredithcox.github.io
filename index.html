			For the past few summers, I've studied granular materials in Professor Bob Behringer's lab at Duke University. My research was published in EPL (Europhysics Letters), where it was selected as Editor's Choice. You can read the paper <a href = "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/115/64003/meta">here</a>. In addition, I have:
			<br>
			<ul>
				<br>
				<li>Presented research at the 68th Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics.</li>
				<li>Had research I've worked on presented at the 69th Annual Meeting of the APS DFD and APS March Meeting.</li>
				<li>Presented a poster a Dynamics Days XXXV, an international conference in nonlinear dynamics.</li>
				<li>Have been selected as a semifinalist in the Intel Science Talent Search 2016.</li>

				I built an online store in response to a problem: A clothing aesthetic that I enjoy is usually sold cheaply and made with questionable labor practices. I decided to create a store that pairs a unique and minimalist look with ethical practices. Having no formal design or business training, I learned on the spot how to use Photoshop, how to build a site showcasing the brand's essential look, and how to use social media to reach my target audience and learn more about what my customers want.

				To learn how to develop both frontend and backend using Ruby on Rails, I created a working site that could potentially be used for my high school.

			<b><p>About</p></b>
			<div id = "text">
				Aside from being a computer science student, I'm also an Organizational Commmittee Member in Columbia University's Society of Women Engineers, in which I'm helping coordinate a day-long event for high school girls called the Engineering Exploration Experience. 
				<br><br>
				I also enjoy playing the piano and have received international recognition for playing duets with my younger brother.
				<br><br>
				In my free time, I like to run and dance in Orchesis, a dance group at Columbia University.
				<br>
				<br>
				I built this site and it's very new, so please contact me if you have any issues!
